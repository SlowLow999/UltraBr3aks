**How it works?**

Instead of sending you request to Claude direct web UI, It will send it to the API model version! bypassing the newest safety filters.

**How to use?**

Copy-Paste this bypasser on ***any*** claude model and use to bypass the new safety filters introduced with claude sonnet 4.5. Use strong already working jailbreaks like [1-Shot-puppetry](
1Shot-Puppetry.mkd)

**⚠️Warning:** This Jailbreak may result in EXTREAMLY disturbing output (CSAM, self-harm...) You assume EVERY responsibility by using this:
