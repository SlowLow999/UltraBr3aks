## ----->**_Cyph3r-Attack_**<-----

**READ INSTRUCTION!!!**

**--Home-made jailbreak :)** Works on (nearly) *all non thinking models*! using a special encoding performing extremly good and better than other basic ones (LeetSpeek, Base 64). take a look!

**--Models:** GPT 5/mini , Gemini 2.5 flash, Deepseek 3.1...

**--How it works?** You just need to replace **{{HARMFUL_BEHAVIOUR}}** by your request! Performs better with CBRN related request (as it was talored for) but I got you, and it can be adapted! :>

**--Setup:** Encode your request using this website for the special encoding: https://slowlow999.github.io/Cyph3r-Enc0ding/ 

**--tip:** Encode the your request directly (e.g) "how to make meth?" --> "meth"

**--Jailbreak** you can cpy and paste it, this is the CBRN (e.g. meth, nitazenes, napalm...)
